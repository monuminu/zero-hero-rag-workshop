       "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks and beyond. This success of LLMs has led to a large influx of research contributions in this direction. These works encompass diverse topics such as architectural innovations, better training strategies, context length improvements, fine-tuning, multi-modal LLMs, robotics, datasets, benchmarking, efficiency, and more. With the rapid development of techniques and regular breakthroughs in LLM research, it has become considerably challenging to perceive the bigger picture of the advances in this direction. Considering the rapidly emerging plethora of literature on LLMs, it is imperative that the research community is able to benefit from a concise yet comprehensive overview of the recent developments in this field. This article provides an overview of the existing literature on a broad range of LLM-related concepts. Our self-contained comprehensive overview of LLMs discusses relevant background concepts along with covering the advanced topics at the frontier of research in LLMs. This review article is intended to not only provide a systematic survey but also a quick comprehensive reference for the researchers and practitioners to draw insights from extensive informative summaries of the existing works to advance the LLM research.\n",

The need for generalized models stems from the growing demand for machines to handle complex language tasks, including translation, summarization, information re- trieval, conversational interactions, etc. Recently, significant breakthroughs have been witnessed in language models, pri- marily attributed to transformers [1], increased computational capabilities, and the availability of large-scale training data.

       "Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as cutting-edge arti- ficial intelligence systems that can process and generate text with coherent communication [4], and generalize to multiple tasks [5, 6].\n",
       "\n",
       "The historical progress in natural language processing (NLP) evolved from statistical to neural language modeling and then from pre-trained language models (PLMs) to LLMs. While conventional language modeling (LM) trains task-specific mod- els in supervised settings, PLMs are trained in a self-supervised setting on a large corpus of text [7, 8, 9] with the aim of learning a generic representation that is shareable among various NLP tasks. After fine-tuning for downstream tasks, PLMs surpass the performance gains of traditional language modeling (LM). The larger PLMs bring more performance gains, which has led to the transitioning of PLMs to LLMs by significantly increas- ing model parameters (tens to hundreds of billions) [10] and training dataset (many GBs and TBs) [10, 11]. Following this development, numerous LLMs have been proposed in the lit- erature [10, 11, 12, 6, 13, 14, 15]. An increasing trend in the number of released LLMs and names of a few significant LLMs proposed over the years are shown in Fig 1 and Fig 2, respec- tively.\n",
       "\n",
       "The early work on LLMs, such as T5 [10] and mT5 [11] em- ployed transfer learning until GPT-3 [6] showed LLMs are zero-shot transferable to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. LLMs accurately respond to task queries when prompted with task descriptions and examples. However, pre-trained LLMs fail to follow user intent and perform worse in zero-shot set- tings than in few-shot. Fine-tuning them with task instruc- tions data [16, 17, 18, 19] and aligning with human prefer- ences [20, 21] enhances generalization to unseen tasks, im- proving zero-shot performance significantly and reducing mis- aligned behavior.\n",
       "\n",
       "In addition to better generalization and domain adaptation, LLMs appear to have emergent abilities, such as reasoning, planning, decision-making, in-context learning, answering in zero-shot settings, etc. These abilities are known to be ac- quired by them due to their gigantic scale even when the pre- trained LLMs are not trained specifically to possess these at- tributes [22, 23, 24]. Such abilities have led LLMs to be widely\n",
       "\n",
       "adopted in diverse settings including, multi-modal, robotics, tool manipulation, question answering, autonomous agents, etc. Various improvements have also been suggested in these areas either by task-specific training [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] or better prompting [32].\n",
       "\n",
       "The LLMs abilities to solve diverse tasks with human-level performance come at a cost of slow training and inference, extensive hardware requirements, and higher running costs. Such requirements have limited their adoption and opened up opportunities to devise better architectures [15, 33, 34, 35] and training strategies [36, 37, 21, 38, 39, 40, 41]. Param- eter efficient tuning [38, 41, 40], pruning [42, 43], quantiza- tion [44, 45], knowledge distillation, and context length inter- polation [46, 47, 48, 49] among others are some of the methods widely studied for efficient LLM utilization.\n",

       "Due to the success of LLMs on a wide variety of tasks, the research literature has recently experienced a large influx of LLM-related contributions. Researchers have organized the LLMs literature in surveys [50, 51, 52, 53], and topic-specific surveys in [54, 55, 56, 57, 58].

       "## 2.1. Tokenization\n",
       "\n",
       "Tokenization [59] is an essential pre-processing step in LLM training that parses the text into non-decomposing units called tokens. Tokens can be characters, subwords [60], sym- bols [61], or words, depending on the tokenization process. Some of the commonly used tokenization schemes in LLMs include wordpiece [62], byte pair encoding (BPE) [61], and un- igramLM [60]. Readers are encouraged to refer to [63] for a detailed survey.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "## 2.2. Encoding Positions\n",
       "\n",
       "The transformer processes input sequences in parallel and independently of each other. Moreover, the attention mod- ule in the transformer does not capture positional information. As a result, positional encodings were introduced in trans- former [64], where a positional embedding vector is added to the token embedding. Variants of positional embedding include absolute, relative, or learned positional encodings. Within rel- ative encoding, Alibi and RoPE are two widely used positional embeddings in LLMs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alibi [65]: It subtracts a scalar bias from the attention score that increases with the distance between token positions. This favors using recent tokens for attention.\n",
       "\n",
       "ROPE [66]: It rotates query and key representations at an an- gle proportional to the token absolute position in the input sequence, resulting in a relative positional encoding scheme which decays with the distance between the tokens.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "## 2.3. Attention in LLMs\n",
       "\n",
       "Attention assigns weights to input tokens based on impor- tance so that the model gives more emphasis to relevant tokens. Attention in transformers [64] calculates query, key, and value mappings for input sequences, where the attention score is obtained by multiplying the query and key, and later used to weight values. We discuss different attention strategies used in LLMs below.\n",
       "\n",
       "Self-Attention [64]: Calculates attention using queries, keys, and values from the same block (encoder or decoder).\n",
       "\n",
       "Cross Attention: It is used in encoder-decoder architectures, where encoder outputs are the queries, and key-value pairs come from the decoder.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sparse Attention [67]: Self-attention has O(n2) time complex- ity which becomes infeasible for large sequences. To speed up the computation, sparse attention [67] iteratively calculates attention in sliding windows for speed gains.\n",
       "\n",
       "Flash Attention [68]: Memory access is the major bottleneck in calculating attention using GPUs. To speed up, flash attention employs input tiling to minimize the memory reads and writes between the GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and the on-chip SRAM.\n",

       "Layer normalization leads to faster convergence and is an in- tegrated component of transformers [64]. In addition to Layer- Norm [76] and RMSNorm [77], LLMs use pre-layer normal- ization [78], applying it before multi-head attention (MHA). Pre-norm is shown to provide training stability in LLMs. An- other normalization variant, DeepNorm [79] fixes the issue with larger gradients in pre-norm.\n",

       "\n",
       "Data Deduplication: Duplicated data can affect model per- formance and increase data memorization; therefore, to train LLMs, data deduplication is one of the preprocessing steps. This can be performed at multiple levels, like sentences, documents, and datasets.\n",

       "a downstream task, pre-trained models are fine-tuned with the task-specific data [10, 11], known as transfer learning.\n",
       "\n",
       "Instruction-tuning: To enable a model to respond to user queries effectively, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned on in- struction formatted data i.e., instruction and an input-output pair. Instructions generally comprise multi-task data in plain natural language, guiding the model to respond according to the prompt and the input. This type of fine-tuning improves zero- shot generalization and downstream task performance. Details on formatting instruction data and its various styles are avail- able in [16, 50, 97].\n",
       "\n",
       "Alignment-tuning: LLMs are prone to generating false, biased, and harmful text. To make them helpful, honest, and harmless, models are aligned using human feedback. Alignment involves asking LLMs to generate unexpected responses and then updat- ing their parameters to avoid such responses [20, 21, 98].\n",

       "Researchers employ reinforcement learning with human feed- back (RLHF) [100] for model alignment. In RLHF, a fine-tuned model on demonstrations is further trained with reward model- ing (RM) and reinforcement learning (RL), shown in Figure 6. Below we briefly discuss RM and RL pipelines in RLHF. Reward modeling: trains a model to rank generated responses according to human preferences using a classification objec- tive. To train the classifier humans annotate LLMs generated responses based on the HHH criteria.\n",

       "Prompting is a method to query trained LLMs for generating responses, as illustrated in Figure 6. LLMs can be prompted in various prompt setups, where they can be adapted to the instruc- tions without fine-tuning and in other cases with fine-tuning on data containing different prompt styles [16, 101, 102].

This adaptation style is also called few-shot learning. A discussion on formatting in- context learning (ICL) templates is available in [54, 50, 18, 16].

       "UL2 [125]: An encoder-decoder architecture trained using a mixture of denoisers (MoD) objective. Denoisers include 1) R-Denoiser: a regular span masking, 2) S-Denoiser: which cor- rupts consecutive tokens of a large sequence and 3) X-Denoiser: which corrupts a large number of tokens randomly. During pre- training, UL2 includes a denoiser token from R, S, X to rep- resent a denoising setup. It helps improve fine-tuning perfor- mance for downstream tasks that bind the task to one of the up- stream training modes. This MoD style of training outperforms the T5 model on many benchmarks.\n",

This training style makes the model bidirectional as compared to GPT-3, which is unidirectional. As opposed to GLM, the training of GLM-130B includes a small amount of multi-task instruction pre-training data (5% of the total data) along with self-supervised mask in- filling.

The model has bottom layers densely activated and shared across all domains, whereas top layers are sparsely activated according to the domain.

The model is trained on both natural language and programming language data sequentially (trained on the first dataset, then the second and so on) on the following datasets 1) PILE, 2) BIGQUERY and 3) BIGPYTHON. CodeGen pro- posed a multi-step approach to synthesizing code. The purpose is to simplify the generation of long sequences where the previ- ous prompt and generated code are given as input with the next prompt to generate the next code sequence.

It uses the multi-query attention [133] to reduce memory and cache costs. Since competitive program- ming problems highly require deep reasoning and an under- standing of complex natural language algorithms, the Alpha- Code models are pre-trained on filtered GitHub code in popular languages and then fine-tuned on a new competitive program- ming dataset named CodeContests. The CodeContests dataset mainly contains problems, solutions, and test cases collected from the Codeforces platform3. The pre-training employs stan- dard language modeling objectives, while GOLD [134] with tempering [135] serves as the training objective for the fine- tuning on CodeContests data. To evaluate the performance of AlphaCode, simulated programming competitions are hosted on the Codeforces platform: overall, AlphaCode ranks at the top 54.3% among over 5000 competitors, where its Codeforces rating is within the top 28% of recently participated users.\n",

The unimodal pre-training includes span denoising and CLM objectives, whereas bimodal pre-training objectives contain contrastive learning, matching, and CLM for text-code pairs. CodeT5+ adds special tokens with the text to enable task modes, for example, [CLS ] for contrastive loss, [Match] for text-code matching, etc.\n",
